    <h1>A Brief History of Silver</h1>
    <p>
      For thousands of years, silver has stood at the crossroads of money, power, and human ingenuity. Long before paper currencies or digital ledgers, silver was trusted as a universal store of value - shaped into coins, ornaments, and trade goods that connected civilizations across continents.
    </p>
    <p>
      From ancient empires that minted silver as the backbone of their economies, to dramatic modern-era battles over supply, speculation, and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver's story mirrors humanity's ongoing struggle between real value and manufactured promises. Understanding this history isn't just academic - it explains why silver still matters today.
